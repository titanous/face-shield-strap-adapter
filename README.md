# Face Shield Strap Adapter

![3D render of adapter](build/render.png)

This is an adapter designed for the [Maker Nexus Prusa Face Shield Remix](https://github.com/makernexus/prusa-covid19-shield-remix) that makes it compatible with a continuously adjustable elastic strap that is approximately 15mm wide and 2mm thick. It is likely compatible with other face shield frame designs that use the same mount design like the [Prusa Face Shield](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/25857-prusa-face-shield).
